        <h2>Becoming more Independent</h2>
        <p>Now at 18, Isabella feels like she’s becoming more like an adult, but still discovering what that really means. College life always keeps her busy with classes, assignments, and even after class. But, the biggest challenge for her is is learning to manage life on her own in a foreign country.</p>

        <h2>Day in the Life of Isabella</h2>
        <p>Her days recently have been a combination of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Attending classes</li>
            <li>Completing homework</li>
            <li>Chilling in the nighttime.</li>
          </ul>
        <p> She realized that even the small, ordinary moments can feel big (ex. like surviving a 16-hour flight) and realizing how much she’s learning to live on her own.</p>
